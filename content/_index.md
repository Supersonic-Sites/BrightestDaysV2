        desc: Super awesome paint job from a super awesome guy! We were very impressed
          by Jamie's work, communication and painting knowledge. He even was
          able to fix some siding on our house that he spotted while he was
          doing the work. Jamie went above and beyond our expectations and would
          highly recommend him!
